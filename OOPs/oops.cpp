// Procedural Programming (functions)
// -----------------------
// - means we make lot of procedures or functions

// Object Oriented Programming(OOPs)-->feature of programming languages
// ----------------------------
// - style of writing code in which we use a lot of real life data in terms of objects
// - car dog etc are entities in real world so we will use these entities as objects
// - real world entities => as objects in program
// - object contains some data members and also some functions

// car showroom owner -> use software to sell/update info about car
// for eg model no., name, price, MRP, Features[]
// these things grouped together in a bucket that will be called as car object
// then the array of these buckets will be called as array of objects
// because each bucket of an array denotes an object

// Class - is a blueprint
// class syntax tell the compiler when you will construct an object what all parameters it will have
//  class doesn't exist in memory its just a piece of code
// when we create an entity out of it
// class can have 1. data members(variables or the attributes that store info about that object ) 2.functions(that are related to that object)

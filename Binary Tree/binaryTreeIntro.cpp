// Binary Tree
// Non linear or the hierarchical
// common operations - insertion , deletion, searching, ordering
// eg - my computer -> cdrive, d drive etc - > they goes to folders in them nd more branches in them
// in linked list each node is connected to one child
// binary means two so every node will have atmost two children

// first node is the root node (parent)
// and branches are children

// ancestors, decendents
// all the parents of a node are ancestors

// all the nodes derived from the parent are decendents

// leaf nodes are the nodes which do not have any child

// parent node or root node will be --> node (datatype of binary tree)
// children will be --> node*

// traversal types
// preorder, inorder, postorder, levelorder

// preorder -> root then left child then right child
// inorder -> left then root then right
// postorder(bottom up traversal)-> left then right then root
// levelorder -> at first level the parent then second level children left and right then third level and continue
